Introduction:

My words based on lecture.
kafka is a messaging system designed to replace the cumbersome point-to-point communication protocols,
star (hub  and spoke networks), and MESH networks for message queue communications.
Those message systems that require centralized message routing, control, etc.
They are tightly coupled systems...

Offical description:
Kafka is a distributed messaging sytem providing fast, highly available scalable
and redundant messaging system through a pub-sub (Publish - Subscribe) model,

Kafka as a messaging, storing and streaming messaging system is a powerful scalable
streaming platform, allows processing, storing, and streaming applications and streaming
data pipeplines.
Enables:
Publish and Subscribe: to stream of data like a messaging system.
Process:  streams of data efficiently and in real time.
Store: streams of data safely in a distributed replicated cluster.

By storing and processing the data applications can treat past present (and future)
data in the same way.


This is a somewhat passive system that allows producers to push messages to the kafka
database and consumers to pull from those messages at will.
- The data is persistent because it is not deleted after it is read by the consumers,
so it can be read at will multiple times (based on the offset).
Kafka is a loosely coupled system = message oriented system... and scalable.

Kafka is a distributed multi-component architecture that is known as a Publish-Subscribe
messaging pattern / System.
-These systems have more than one publisher and more than one subscriber to "topics"
and often has more than one queue manager.
This is a topic based system.

The topic is the focus publishers and subscribers can be ignorant of each other.
 - The possible problems or disadvantages:
   message delivery issues,
   inability to search for records,
